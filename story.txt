Jorry awoke with a sudden start, panting and gasping, and his bedsheets were soaked with sweat. Nothing appeared out of order to him; his small, cramped room was the same it
had always been, and to have the room was a luxury in itself, he reflected for a moment. He was clearly troubled by something; whether that was dreams or simply his own whim 
calling him from slumber was another matter entirely. The first thing he noticed was the odd smell as he slowly came to. It washed over his senses, seeming to increase in 
correlation with his consciousness. It was not odd in the way that it was necessarily an unpleasant scent; but it was certainly out of place. A smell usually inhabited by that 
of tobacco smoke and incense hanging dully in the air was now filled with the smell of something sweet and succinct. 
After a moment he got out of bed, quietly, as if he was afraid to disturb the smell. He walked to the door slowly, the floorboards creaking underneath him. He opened the door and stuck his head into the narrow hallway. There was nothing out of the ordinary as far as he could see, but the smell had gotten stronger. So, he walked further down the hallway towards the staircase, watching and listening closely for anything out of the ordinary. Finally, he walked down the staircase into the small kitchen. As he rounded the corner, the source of the smell became apparent to him. A tree of some sort had grown overnight in the middle of the kitchen, and it seemed like the sweet smell was coming from the fruit on it. The fruit was like nothing he'd ever seen before, and he had no idea how a tree could've sprouted up so quickly. He pulled a fruit off the tree as he approached it, confirming it was indeed where the smell was coming from.
